## Getting Started 
This web application using Firebase to add new trains, arrival times, and days. Firebase is a front database that allows you to store changes and updates to your application. 

1. The first step for this application is to setup a Firebase account, and then setup a new databse for your train scheduler. 

2. Then add Bootstraps links to your HTML. This step is very important because if this isn't added none of your CSS and JavaScript will be added to your project. 

3. Next add JavaScript, Jquery, and Moment.js to your code. Adding these technologies to your code will ensure that when users click an item or add updates, then these new updates will be added to the train schedule. 

4. Moment.js is allows users to add dates and times to the scheduler.
