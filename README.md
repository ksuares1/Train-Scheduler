## Getting Started 
This web application using Firebase to add new trains, arrival times, and days. Firebase is a front database that allows you to store changes and updates to your application. 

1. The first step for this application is to setup a Firebase account, and then setup a new databse for your train scheduler. 

2. Then add Bootstraps links to your HTML. This step is very important because if this isn't added none of your CSS and JavaScript will be added to your project.
